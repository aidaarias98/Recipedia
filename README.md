## Recipedia

Recipedia is a react application that allows users to input food items and in turn, receive a multitude of recipes along with all of their nutritional value and steps. Our app also provides a variety of pantry locations that provide food for the community. With this app, our group wanted to bring attention to the low access to healthy foods in low-income areas. We believe that access to healthy food is a privilege that should be accessible to all no matter their status.

## Features
Healthy recipes from a third-party api (EDAMAM) 
You can enter a dish/drink/sweet you'd like to make, like "coffee and croissant" or "chicken enchilada" and recieve different recipes. Edamam's API has accurate data with tens of thousands of foods, including international dishes.
Users can also register to the Newsletter with their names, email, and phone and that will be stored in our MYSQL database.


## Using and Running our app
In order to begin using our app.....
Download the app to your local machine. Delete all the "package-lock.json" file. Next, open a terminal and go to the server directory(cd server) and do a npm insall and then go to the clinet folder (cd client) and do npm start.

To get the app running 
You will open a terminal for your server (cd server) and then npm start. And open another terminal for your client folder (cd client) and do another npm start. If you accidently kill ther terminal this is how you would get the app up and running again.
To get conneted with the mysql database you are going to go in the "server" folder and go to the "config" folder in here you will change lines 3-5 to your personal mysql info. 

## Stopping the app
To Stop the app from working all you wanna do is either kill the terminal or open a terminal for your client folder (cd client) and in the terminal you can do "ctrl" and "C" at the same time on your keyboard to stop the react app from running.
