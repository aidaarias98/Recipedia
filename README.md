## Recipedia
![Recipedia](../images/hopehacksLogo.webp)
Recipedia is a react application that allows users to input food items and in turn, receive a multitude of recipes along with all of their nutritional value and steps. Our app also provides a variety of pantry locations that provide food for the community. With this app, our group wanted to bring attention to the low access to healthy foods in low-income areas. We believe that access to healthy food is a privilege that should be accessible to all no matter their status.
