              <h2>We are Recipedia</h2>
              <p>
                Recipedia, located in Charlotte North Carolina, was built on the
                principle that everyone deserves equal access to affordable and
                healthy foods. Many individuals in lower income communities have
                access to an over abundance amount of unhealthy foods. As a result,
                there has been a 21% to 54% increase in heart disease in lower
                income communities. This is where Recipedia comes in, we have
                developed relationships with a variety of pantries across the
                Charlotte area to allow low income families equal access to
                healthier foods.

              <p>
                Beginning in 2017, Recipedia has grown a significant amount thanks
                to the positive changes it has seen in communities all over
                Charlotte. What began as one location, we have now expanded to over
                9 pantry locations over Charlotte to date. With more locations on
                the horizon, Recipedia is looking to continue providing healthy
                ingredients and recipes to all around Charlotte.

                organizations such as Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina INC,

              <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
              <p>
                Since the start, our mission has been and will continue to be making
                healthy foods and ingredients available to all. Nowadays, organic
                foods are difficult to come by depending on income and we believe
                that accessibility to healthy foods is a privilege that should be
                afforded to all no matter class or race.
